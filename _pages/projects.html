<ul>
<li>Lasso Regularized Logistic Regression classifier for COVID detection</li>
<p>This project is regarding a Lasso Regularized Logistic Regression model intended to detect covid-19 from Raman spectroscopy.As the number of features was very large compared to number of observations , we resorted to Lasso regression to avoid overfitting . The model is initialized with a liblinear solver along with L1 (lasso) penalty.The model achieved 97% accuracy on the test dataset . </p>

<li>Customer Churn Prediction Web App </li>
<p>A multi-layer perceptron classifier model runs in the backend of this web app to predict
  customer churn in context of the telecom industry. The model has attained 96 % accuracy on
  the test dataset. This project has been deployed to Heroku utilizing Flask web framework. </p>


<li>Pulsar Star Prediction</li>

<p>A random forest classifier model to distinguish pulsar stars from others . The dataset used in
  this project is HTRU2. The model achieved 97.82 % accuracy on the test dataset .This is an
  example of class imbalance problem. So, to handle the class imbalance problem , I leveraged the
  setting of random forest classifier’s ‘class weight = balanced’ wherein classes are automatically
  weighted inversely proportional to how frequently they appear in the data.</p>
