# About Me
* I'm currently pursuing Bachelors in Computer Science at [Shahjalal University of Science and Technology](https://www.sust.edu/). [[CV](https://rajoy99.github.io/academic/files/CV4.pdf)] 

* My research interest lies in the intersection of Machine learning explainability, Computer Vision and Geospatial Data Science. Quite recently, I have been working on SRGANs to downscale climatological data. 




My areas of interest are:
<ul>
<li>Explainable Machine learning </li>
<li>Computer Vision </li>
<li>SRGANs </li>
</ul>
